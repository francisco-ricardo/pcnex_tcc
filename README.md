# Public Competition Notice Expert System (PCNEX)

PCNEX is an innovative project aimed at automating the creation of public tender notices using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. This repository contains the original version of the project developed by Francisco Ricardo Taborda Aguiar as part of his undergraduate thesis at the Federal University of Paraná in 2006. The project was initially implemented using Jess, a rule engine for the Java platform.

## Abstract

The project is an expert system built using the JESS (Java Expert System Shell) language to create public tender notices. The software employs AI techniques to produce accurate and consistent public competition notices. Its primary goal is to address the challenges of generating these announcements for the Nucleus of Competitions at the Federal University of Paraná. The production rules used by the system were developed based on interviews with a human expert, ensuring the system mirrors expert decision-making. Through a user-friendly interface, the software collects relevant information about the competition and applies a set of interconnected rules to the data and facts. As a result, the system generates a fully structured and completed tender notice file.

## Key Features

- **Jess Implementation**: The project uses Jess (Java Expert System Shell) to build the expert system for generating public competition notices.
- **AI-Driven Automation**: Employs AI techniques to produce accurate and consistent public competition notices.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Contains the full text of the thesis and documentation explaining the original implementation and design choices.

## Current Development

**Please note that this repository contains the original implementation in Jess.** The project is currently being restructured and updated to work with recent versions of CLIPS. Future updates will aim to enhance functionality, improve user experience, and expand the system to cover additional sections of public competition notices.

## Goals

- Preserve and document the original Jess-based implementation of the expert system.
- Facilitate the transition to a more modern implementation using CLIPS.
- Provide a comprehensive resource for understanding and developing expert systems for public competition notices.
